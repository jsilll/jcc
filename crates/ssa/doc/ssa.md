This document explains how I would implement an SSA-based compiler if I was writing one today.

This document is intentionally opinionated. It just tells you how I would do it. This document is intended for anyone who has read about SSA and understands the concept, but is confused about how exactly to put it into practice. If you're that person, then I'm here to show you *a* way to do it that works well for me. If you're looking for a review of other ways to do it, I recommend [this post](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/ssa/). 

My approach works well when implementing the compiler in any language that easily permits cyclic mutable data structures. I know from experience that it'll work great in C++, C#, or Java. The memory management of this approach is simple (and I'll explain it), so you won't have to stress about use after frees.

I like my approach because it leads to an ergonomic API by minimizing the amount of special cases you have to worry about. Most of the compiler is analyses and transformations over the IR. If the IR's API is great, then the compiler passes are easy to write, succinct, and read almost like the pseudocode in a compiler textbook. This speeds maintenance of the compiler, and makes it cheap (in terms of labor) to add optimizations. This then lets you add lots of optimizations quickly, which leads to the compiler having lots of optimizations, which then leads to great throughput and happy users.

The key ideas:

- Instruction-value uniformity. Each instruction is a value, and each value is an instruction. Phi is an instruction. Even a constant is an instruction. Let's call it an `Inst` for the purpose of this doc. SSA data flow is represented by each `Inst` having an `args` vector, which is of type `vector<Inst*>`. So, each data flow edge is represented as a pointer from the user `Inst` (where the data flows to) to the `Inst` being used (where the data flows from).

- Phi/Upsilon form, [also described here](https://gist.github.com/pizlonator/79b0aa601912ff1a0eb1cb9253f5e98d). This decouples the CFG from the SSA form, which makes all CFG transforms easier to write. It doesn't inhibit the implementation of any SSA optimization that I know of (i.e. it's exactly as powerful as SSA). It's also easy to compile out of (if you want to exit SSA).

- Arrays. Each function body is just `vector<BasicBlock*>`. Each basic block contains its instructions by just having a `vector<Inst*>`. Each basic block knows its index in the function body vector. Each `Inst` knows its index in its basic block's `Inst` vector. I'll explain how to make this fast and ergonomic.

- Absence of use lists. I find it easier to build the IR, and not any harder to use it, if there are no edges from `Inst`s to the `Inst`s that use them.

- Uniform effect representation. Each `Inst` can produce for you a description of its effects. If an `Inst` reports no effects, then this means that it can be evaluated at any point in the program where its `args` are available, can be evaluated repeatedly, and doesn't have to evaluated at all if nobody uses its result. The effect specification is in terms of *abstract heaps* written or read. Instructions that don't write any abstract heaps, and whose result are unused, can be deleted. There's no other way to say "don't kill this instruction" or "don't reoder this instruction in a way that would break". So, phases that want to consider the interferences between instructions don't have to special case anything to be effective; they just query the instruction effects.

# Syntax for SSA

Here's an `Inst`:

    Int32 A = Add(B, C, foo.hipsterlang:666)

Each `Inst` has a:

- Type (`Int32` in this example).

- Name (`A` in this example). Could be a monotonically increasing integer, or a string, or whatever makes you happy.

- Opcode (`Add` in this example).

- Arguments, represented as `vector<Inst*>` (`B, C` in this example - so the `B` and the `C` are really pointers to `Inst`s called `B` and `C`).

- An origin. At a minimum, this can store a stack of filename:linenumber pairs. This is optional in the sense that some instructions might not have an origin. (`foo.hipsterlang:666` in this example.)

`Inst` forms a class hierarchy, because some `Inst`s will want more data. For example, all literals/constants/immediates are represented by instructions that return them, like:

    Int32 One = Const(1)
    Int32 X = Sub(A, One)

Here, the `1` argument to Const is not part of the Inst's arguments. Instead, there a `ConstInst` subclass of `Inst` that has an extra field that holds the immediate.

The fact that constants are `Inst`s reduces the number of special cases in the compiler. For example, consider that you might want to do a transformation where every value is filtered through the Wombat opcode - so Foo(Bar(42)) would become Wombat(Foo(Wombat(Bar(Wombat(42))))). If constants were not `Inst`s, then you'd have to write a special case for filtering the constants. But since constants are just `Inst`s in my representation, you'd just insert a Wombat after each `Inst`. Also, if you wanted to analyze what are all of the values that might be used by a function, this representation just requires you to loop over `Inst`s in the function rather than also considering some objects on the side (like constant values). There is no cost to doing this, since Const has no effects and no `Inst` inputs, so repeated uses of Const(1) can be combined into one and hoisted by the common subexpression elimination and loop invariant code motion passes that you'll be writing anyway. And, since it's SSA, you can always pattern match constants flowing into instructions, like:

    if (inst->opcode() == Add &&
        inst->args(1)->opcode() == Const &&
        inst->args(1)->as<ConstInst>()->value() == 0)
        inst->replaceWithIdentity(inst->args(0));

I like to give myself helpers for this in `Inst` so I can even do:

    if (inst->opcode() == Add && inst->args(1)->isConst(0))
        inst->replaceWithIdentity(inst->args(0));

You'll want some kind of richer types, including probably tuples and vectors. It's OK to use `IntPtr` as your pointer type, if you're compiling something like C, or if you're at the stage of a high-level language compiler pipeline where you understand the IR using low-level concepts like pointers.

Each function is just basic blocks that can branch to one another however they like. Logically, the successors of a basic block are arguments to the terminal instruction in that block, but I like to store them in the `BasicBlock` itself. Here's an example function.

    root:
        Int32 A = GetArgument(0)
        Int32 B = GetArgument(1)
        Void B = Branch(A)
      successors: then, else
    then:
        Int32 One = Const(1)
        Int32 X = Add(B, One)
        Void R1 = Return(X)
    else:
        Int32 Two = Const(2)
        Int32 Y = Mul(B, Two)
        Void R2 = Return(Y)

Note that even instructions that don't return a value have a name and their type is Void. This makes debugging the compiler easier and removes special-cases.

Also note that even function arguments are represented as their own `Inst`s (the GetArgument instructions in the example), to preserve the instruction-value uniformity. The GetArgument instruction is pure like Const, so repeated uses are free (they will be combined by common subexpression elimination and hoisted by loop invariant code motion).

I allow unreachable basic blocks and unstructured control flow.

I wouldn't give each basic block a list of predecessors, but I would have a utility function that returns a map from `BasicBlock*` to its predecessors. I.e. it returns something like a `map<BasicBlock*, set<BasicBlock*>>`. This is cheap to compute because you'll do it once per compiler pass (in the worst case - some passes won't need it) and the rest of the compiler pass is most likely considering every instruction. There are many more instructions than blocks, so generally, algorithms that are `O(number of blocks)` don't show up as bottlenecks.

It's important to have a `validate` pass that you can run in between compiler passes that checks that the IR is following the rules (like, if `A` is used by `B` then `A` must dominate `B`).

# Phi/Upsilon Form

[Phi/Upsilon form is also described as "Pizlo form" in this document.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pizlonator/79b0aa601912ff1a0eb1cb9253f5e98d/raw/050e878649923d44ccc766929d2473f85c2b6332/pizlossa.md)

Phi/Upsilon form is a way to implement SSA's Phi without introducing any concepts that make `Inst`s more complicated. The Phi is split into two parts, that I call Phi and Upsilon. Phi and Upsilon instruction opcodes minimize the amount of special casing in the compiler's guts. You only have to worry about the special properties of Phi and Upsilon when doing optimizations specifically to the Phis and Upsilons, or when doing data flow analysis. "Not special casing" means for example that a Phi or Upsilon is allowed to appear anywhere in the basic block's array of `Inst`s. Another example of "not special casing" is that the Phi `Inst` doesn't point to any basic blocks, and doesn't have any special kinds of use edges. One big implication is that control flow transforms don't have to do anything about Phi or Upsilon (they are as simple to write as control flow transforms outside SSA).

Normal SSA means that each `Inst` has an implicit variable associated with it, and when the `Inst` executes, it assigns the result to that variable. Then all of the places where another `Inst` points at our `Inst` are just reads from that variable. Those semantics are important to keep in your head when writing compiler code in SSA. This is the key place where Phi/Upsilon adds a special case: a Phi instruction has a second variable associated with it, called the shadow variable. You'll have to model that shadow variable in any data flow analysis of Phi/Upsilon SSA form.

Upsilon is written like this:

    Upsilon(SomeValue, ^SomePhi)

Note that the ^SomePhi "argument" is not part of the `Inst`'s `vector<Inst*>` arguments; it's a special field in `UpsilonInst`. This is important, because it should not be analyzed as a data flow use. Phi is written like this:

    SomePhi = Phi()

Upsilon writes `SomeValue` to the shadow variable of `SomePhi`. Phi reads and returns the current value of its shadow variable. Because the only way to read a shadow variable is to execute that shadow variable's Phi, the Phi-Upsilon relationship follows Static Single Use form - a kind of upside-down SSA.

Let's consider this example program.

    root:
        Int32 A = GetArgument(0)
        Int32 B = GetArgument(1)
        Void B = Branch(A)
      successors: then, else
    then:
        Int32 One = Const(1)
        Int32 X1 = Add(B, One)
        Void U1 = Upsilon(X1, ^X)
        Void J1 = Jump()
      successors: return
    else:
        Int32 Two = Const(2)
        Int32 X2 = Mul(B, Two)
        Void U2 = Upsilon(X2, ^X)
        Void J2 = Jump()
      successors: return
    return:
        Int32 X = Phi()
        Int32 FortyTwo = Const(42)
        Int32 RS = Add(X, FortyTwo)
        Void RT = Return(RS)

This IR is equivalent to the following C function.

    int foo(int a, int b)
    {
        int x;
        if (a)
            x = b + 1
        else
            x = b * 2
        return x + 42;
    }

I describe Upsilon and Phi as having effects. I'll also tell you even more about this in the next section. The effects are needed to ensure that we don't reorder or remove Upsilons and Phis incorrectly.

- Upsilons cannot be reordered arbitrarily. Since an Upsilon is an assignment, reordering two Upsilons that refer to the same Phi would change the program's meaning.

- Phis cannot be reordered with Upsilons, since the Phis read the value written by the Upsilon.

The easiest way to achieve this is to invent an abstract heap called SSAState and have Upsilon report that it writes to the heap as part of its effects, and have Phi report that it reads from the heap as part of its effects. You could make this more precise by giving a separate abstract heap for each Phi.

The main benefit of this form is that basic blocks - and all CFG data structures - have zero knowledge about SSA. There are no basic block arguments. There's no requirement that Phis appear at the tops of blocks. In fact, this is a valid program in Pizlo form (albeit suboptimal):

    Int32 M = Stuff(...)
    Void U = Upsilon(M, ^N)
    SomeType W = Whatever()
    Int32 N = Phi()
    SomeType X = MoreStuff(N)

Here, there's a Phi in them middle of a basic block, and there's an Upsilon before it with some stuff in the middle. That's fine. This is important, because it means that you can do CFG transforms that blow away control flow edges without worrying about fixing your Phis.

In any SSA compiler, you'll want simplifications for the SSA operations like Phi. In Phi/Upsilon form the main thing you'll want is a fixpoint rule that if you have a Phi that has Upsilons that only use the Phi or exactly one other value, then replace all uses of the Phi with uses of the other value. You'll also want aggressive dead code elimination to only flag Upsilons as used if their Phis are used. The combination of these optimizations will simplify the previous example to:

    Int32 M = Stuff(...)
    SomeType W = Whatever()
    SomeType X = MoreStuff(M)

Doing such optimizations means you'll want to have a utility pass that gives you the "Phi arguments", i.e. the set of Upsilons that store to the Phi. You'll use this anytime you want to write optimizations that pattern-match over the Phis. Computing the Phi arguments is O(N) (you have to walk the whole program), but that's fine since iterating the IR is cheap (it's just arrays!) and passes are O(N) anyway.

# Arrays

At first glance, it feels most natural to represent basic blocks as linked lists of instructions, since this allows O(1) insertion and removal. But linked lists are annoying to get right and the work required to maintain them properly is not worth it compared to the array approach that I use. One reason for this is that to track dominance between instructions in the same block, you need to know each instruction's index in the block anyway - so even if you use linked lists, you'll need some kind of O(N) index updating pass. Another reason is that in practice, implementing a linked list is harder than just having a `vector<Inst*>`. Finally, linked lists are more expensive to traverse than arrays - and compilers like to traverse all instructions a lot.

One of the subtle reasons why I use arrays rather than linked lists comes down to subjective feelings based on experience: I've worked on multiple compiler IRs that use arrays (Bartok, DFG, [B3, Air](https://webkit.org/blog/5852/introducing-the-b3-jit-compiler/); I designed three of those) and multiple compiler IRs that use linked lists (Fiji C1, LLVM; I designed Fiji and I [do a lot](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/bringing-verse-transactional-memory-semantics-to-c) [of LLVM hacking](https://github.com/pizlonator/llvm-project-deluge/blob/deluge/Manifesto.md)) and I *feel more productive* in the compilers that use arrays. It's not a huge productivity advantage - definitely less than 2x; I also feel productive with linked lists (like LLVM), so it's not an enormous preference.

The biggest reason to use arrays if you're implementing your own IR from scratch is just that the array approach is something like 5x easier to implement. You'll get a lot of mileage out of implementing the array approach using some `vector<>` template, maybe even one in the STL. On the other hand, the linked list approach is really about hacking up custom linked lists (each `Inst` is a linked list node in that world) and so you'll have to get each of the classic linked list algorithms exactly right. That takes way more time than using `vector<Inst*>`, even if you include the things I recommend implementing in this section. So if you want to go zero-to-IR in as little time as possible, just use arrays.

The fact that everything is stored in arrays seems to present a problem for transformation: how do you insert? How do you remove?

If we used arrays naively, then array insertions would be O(N), and so passes would be O(N^2). But there's a trick for avoiding this. The key insight is that passes are going to loop over basic blocks, and then the instructions in those basic blocks, pretty much no matter what. Usually it's because the pass wants to find instructions of interest to it. So, we amortize all insertions and removals behind that existing O(N) pass over the function.

When looping over a basic block (almost always in ascending order), we maintain an `InsertionSet`, which is just a `vector<tuple<size_t, Inst*>>` internally, where the `size_t` is the index where we want to perform an insertion. As we loop over the block, if we decide to perform insertions, we append to the insertion set. We might insert multiple things at the same index. Then, after we are done looping over the basic block, we "execute" the insertion set on the block, which performs a single pass over the basic block's instruction vector to perform all of the insertions while fixing up the indices of the instructions.

This idiom ends up being what a lot of passes look like:

    InsertionSet insertionSet;
    for (BasicBlock* block : function->blocks()) {
        for (Inst* inst : block->insts()) {
            switch (inst->opcode()) {
            case Opcode::Foo:
                // This calls the BarInst::BarInst constructor with inst->type(), Opcode::Bar,
                // inst->arg(0), and inst->origin(). Then it appends the new BarInst to the
                // insertionSet with inst->index() as the insertion index. Finally, it returns the
                // new BarInst.
                inst->arg(0) = insertionSet.insertBefore<BarInst>(
                    inst, inst->type(), Opcode::Bar, inst->arg(0), inst->origin());
                break;
            default:
                break;
            }
        }
        // This performs all of the insertions, fixes the indices (so assuming there was one Foo, that
        // one Foo's index, and the indices of all subsequent instructions, would be one greater than
        // before; and the newly inserted BarInst would get the Foo's old index), and clears the
        // InsertionSet.
        insertionSet.execute(block);
    }

This sample transformation replaces every Foo(X) with Foo(Bar(X)), inserting the Bar instruction just before the Foo instruction. Note that the `insertBefore` method creates a new BarInst object, passes the `inst->type(), Opcode::Bar, inst->arg(0), inst->origin()` arguments to its constructor, and appends the BarInst object to the insertionSet at `inst`'s index.

I like to give InsertionSet additional powers, like detecting if instructions are inserted out-of-order and then stable-sorting the vector in `execute`. This permits this idiom to work (albeit at some perf cost) even if you don't walk the basic block in forward order. Also, passes that need to be able to insert instructions anywhere in the function (not just the block they are walking) can do that by creating a `map<BasicBlock*, InsertionSet>`, and then executing all of the insertion sets after all the work is done.

On the other hand, removal of instructions is just a matter of replacing the instruction with a Nop. You can have InsertionSet remove Nops automatically, or you can have Nop removal be part of dead code elimination. It's no big deal if Nops pile up during optimization, so long as you run something to remove them eventually. The important thing is that you want the lifetime management aspect of instruction removal to be confined to one place - whatever does the Nop removal - to keep the rest of the compiler simple. That Nop removal pass is where you'll handle deallocating instructions (if you're in C++), compacting the basic block vectors, and fixing the indices.

Having insertion and removal deferred has the nice property that IR iterators don't get invalidated. If we used linked lists and had insertions/removals happen eagerly, then we might invalidate whatever iterator we're using to loop over a basic block because we had killed off the instruction that the iterator was on. Having the API for insertion/removal use an explicit deferral means that iterator invalidation is easy to avoid.

I've shown InsertionSet working for the vector of instructions in a basic block, but you'll also end up making it work for basic blocks in a function. I usually have a BlockInsertionSet and an InsertionSet, and they are wrappers around some generic insertion set algorithm that works just as well for `vector<Inst*>` as for `vector<BasicBlock*>`.

Finally, the pervasive use of arrays and the fact that every major IR element (basic blocks, instructions) has an index means that you can have map and set data structures specialize for basic block and instruction keys. If you use a basic block as a key in a map, then the map can just have an array (rather than a tree or hashtable) that uses the block index as the array index. If you use an instruction as a key, then you can use a two-level array (first level uses the instruction's basic block's index, second level uses the instruction's index in the block).

# Absence of Use Lists

The main reason why a compiler would want to know who uses an `Inst` is when replacing all uses of an `Inst` with another `Inst`. But this can be achieved by simply giving each `Inst` the power to transform itself into an Identity in-place.

Then, I just have a utility pass available that short-circuits all uses of Identity(X) to uses of X.

This approach greatly reduces the work required to build the IR itself and leads to a more compact in-memory representation, which then reduces pressure to optimize compile times. How much memory it takes to represent a program affects the compiler's cache locality and also establishes a bound on how big of a program the compiler can handle at all. Not having use lists improves cache locality and allows the compiler to handle larger programs. It also means that naive implementations of compiler passes are more likely to have acceptable running time, which then leads to less time spent optimizing compiler passes for compile time.

Note that the in-place replacement idiom works best if the instruction object *becomes* an Identity instruction object while keeping the same address, so all pointers to it continue to work. I've found that replacing with Jump, replacing with Nop, replacing with Phi, and replacing with Oops (what I call my "unreachable" terminal opcode) are also useful. You can do this in one of two ways, depending on how clever you want to be:

- Have a `Inst::replaceWith` method that does `this->~Inst()` and then `new (this) Inst(stuff)`. This works in C++ and it's safe because all of the instructions that we'd replace with (Identity, Nop, Jump, and Phi) require no additional data beyond what Inst has and so they can use the `Inst` basetype, which is guaranteed to not be larger than any `Inst` instance.

- Just mutate the `Inst`'s opcode to Identity, Nop, Jump, or Phi and have all of the fancy `Inst` subtypes defend against becoming Identity/Nop/Jump/Phi. This is easy to do in practice because you won't have very many virtual functions in `Inst` if you do it right. Maybe the `effects()` function, that I describe in the next section, will be virtual. I'd be tempted to go with this approach if I was writing a new compiler (though I've used the in-place destruct/in-place construct approach previously).

# Uniform Effect Representation

In pure SSA, the only thing preventing reordering of instructions is that users of an `Inst` must be dominated by the `Inst` they are using. But you'll want to represent a variety of operations in SSA that read or write state. You'll also have operations that cannot be reordered for subtle reasons not related to actual reads or writes - for example, you might have instructions that trap, and those instructions cannot be reordered with other control flow.

My approach to handling the interference between instructions is to abstract it as reads and writes to abstract heaps. We will have lots of abstract heaps, and the IR should provide API to the producer of the IR to produce whatever abstract heaps they need to precisely represent interference. Each instruction should be able to report a list of abstract heaps that it reads, and a list of abstract heaps that it writes. Abstract heaps can correspond to things like field names (if you're compiling a language where fields of different names never alias). They can also correspond to special things like the shadow variables used by Phi/Upsilon. If you have a fancy points-to analysis, then abstract heaps could even correspond to points-to set members. We'll have multiple special abstract heaps for the compiler's internal purposes.

Abstract heaps work best when they form a hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy is the World abstract heap. Two abstract heaps interfere with one another if one is an ancestor of the other, or if they are the same heap.

A read of an abstract heap interferes with any write of an interfering abstract heap. A write of an abstract heap interferes with any read or write of an interfering abstract heap.

Because abstract heaps form a hierarchy and they are used exclusively for testing interference, we can represent an abstract heap as a pair of integers (the preorder number in the hierarchy, and the postorder number in the hierarchy). Two abstract heaps interfere if these two ranges overlap.

The purpose of the effect representation baked into the IR is to provide a precise always-available baseline for alias information that is super easy to work with. Abstract heaps serve this purpose well because they can express very precise aliasing information (you can have many abstract heaps, and you can have instructions report that they read/write multiple heaps, so you can be as precise as you want about pairwise interference relationships between instructions). But, it's OK for some passes to use additional alias/effect analysis that gives more precise information. One example is from the previous section, where an Upsilon (which claims to write!) is eliminated because the Phi that referenced it was unused.

Instructions can either store a list of abstract heaps read/written (i.e. store two lists of integer ranges) or you can have a utility function that produces such lists on demand. This is a space-time tradeoff. I've always gone for the latter approach (utility function that produces the read/written abstract heaps on demand), except that call/load/store instructions will explicitly store the affected abstract heaps (so that it's up to the producer of the instruction to tell what heaps they affect). Either way, the goal is to be able to say stuff like:

    if (!inst1->effects().interferesWith(inst2->effects()))
        // do some reordering

And stuff like:

    Effects effects;
    effects.add(inst1->effects();
    effects.add(inst2->effects();
    if (effects.interferesWith(whatever))
        // stuff

You'll want to create effect summaries, for example to keep track of all of the effects that happened in a basic block. The `Effects` data structure can be an interval tree in the general case, though you might want to have a "fast case" for when the number of ranges is small where Effects just uses an array. In practice, Effects often becomes small because your program will have plenty of Calls that claim to read and write all of memory (and the top memory abstract heap just subsumes all of the many little precise ones).

It's up to the producer of the IR to come up with abstract heaps to represent memory. It's fine to create just a single Memory abstract heap if you don't want to be precise (or can't be, like if you're compiling WebAssembly's linear memory accesses). Additionally, the compiler will provide abstract heaps for interferences not related to memory:

- Phi/Upsilon needs to either have a single SSAState abstract heap, or an abstract heap for each Phi if you want to be more precise. In my experience, having a single SSAState abstract heap is adequate. This further reduces the amount of special cases your compiler needs to handle Phis correctly; any pass that uses the effect system as a guardrail will correctly handle Phi and Upsilon.

- Control flow instructions write to the Control abstract heap. All instructions that cannot be reordered around control flow read the Control abstract heap. For example, if you're compiling C then you have to account for the fact that a load instruction may trap, and so hoisting it above a branch might make a correct program trap when it shouldn't (since the branch might have been correlated with the pointer being valid). In my IRs, I prevent this by having the load instruction read the Control heap. Reading Control interferes with writing Control, and branches write to Control, so this trivially blocks that bad transformation. If you're compiling a language like Java, where lots of operations require checks that may throw exceptions (and exception order matters), we might have "side exiting" Check instructions that write Control.

For example, the simplest abstract heap hierarchy that I would have (and maybe what I'd start with) would be:

- World

    - Memory

    - SSAState

    - Control

Depending on the language you're compiling, you might find other cases of dependencies between instructions that are not elegant to express using SSA data flow. You can always express dependencies by having fake data flow edges (that just pass a 0-bit token value), but I find fake SSA data flow to be annoying in practice. So, I like to decompose all of those special dependencies into abstract heaps that I invent for the purpose of getting the dependency relationship that I want. For example, if I want to say that opcode Stuff depends on opcode Thingy in some way, then I would add a StuffThingy abstract heap, have Thingy write to it, and have Stuff read from it.

This approach means that any pass considering whether two instructions can be reordered only needs to ask:

- Is there an SSA data flow dependency between the instructions? If so, then the dominance constraint must be preserved.

- What abstract heaps are read and written by the instructions? If those effect sets interfere, then the instructions cannot be reordered.

Lots of passes will be asking these kinds of questions, so you'll want to make it easy to ask them. A general effect representation combined with instruction-value uniformity means these questions can be asked without ever having to special-case opcodes. And since abstract heaps are pairs of integers, it's cheap to have loads of them, making this a great approach especially if you have very precise alias analysis.

# Closing Thoughts

The approach to building an SSA-based compiler described in this doc is what I would use if I was writing another compiler today. I like it because it's straightforward to implement and leads to succinct code in my experience. The last compiler I wrote this way (B3) generated better code than LLVM generated for WebKit's purposes. So, I'm confident that this approach won't stop you from writing a compiler that generates excellent code.

I'll close by enumerating some additional thoughts I have:

- I recommend implementing Lengauer-Tarjan and using it for all dominance queries as well as conversion to SSA. Lengauer-Tarjan runs quickly and gives you a dominator tree, which means that the "does A dominate B" property can be expressed in O(1) per block. This is because you can walk the dominator tree to get pre/post order numbers, and then blocks just have to store a pair of integers and the dominance query is just a matter of range overlap. Additionally, lots of interesting compiler passes walk the dominator tree, so you'll need it anyway. Once you have Lengauer-Tarjan and you're accustomed to reasoning about dominance queries, it ends up feeling most natural to implement SSA conversion using dominance frontiers rather than any of the other approaches.

- I recommend having some way of representing non-SSA data flow in the IR. One approach is the LLVM one (you just load/store to memory to represent not-SSA). Another approach is to add the concept of a Variable, and have Set/Get instructions for writing and reading the variables (and then you'd also give Set/Get abstract heaps corresponding to the Variable they access).

- I recommend lowering from SSA to something that isn't SSA as part of instruction selection, since optimal instruction selection produces machine code that reassigns to stuff and trying to ascribe SSA form onto register uses and defs is more trouble than it's worth.

- I recommend using graph coloring (in particular, [IRC](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/229542.229546)) as the register allocator, because it's a well documented algorithm and it's competitive (it'll be hard to write a better regalloc). You'll want to have a spill fixup phase after it (basically, a common subexpression elimination for accesses to spill slots). I also recommend graph coloring for stack frame allocation.
